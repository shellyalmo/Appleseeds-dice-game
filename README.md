### Game instructions:
* In your turn - roll the dice (at least once) and accumulate the result in "current".
* You can roll again or click "Hold" to save the points from "Current" and end the turn.
* Note! if you get 6-6 you will lose all points from "Current" and the turn will go to your opponent.
* If you managed to reach exactly the target score - you win! If you passed it - you lose.
